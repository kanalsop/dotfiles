# Git Workflow

This skill owns safe change history and delivery through review and integration: branch and
worktree selection, commit scope and composition, push and PR creation or updates, delivery
verification and CI/review conditions, and authorized merge and Git cleanup. Receive the Issue
number and plan URL from issue-workflow and associate them with the branch or PR as appropriate.

## Operating Rules

- Inspect Git state before edits: current branch, `git status --porcelain=v1`, and recent commit style when commit messages will be written.
- Never overwrite, reset, clean, or discard user changes unless the user explicitly asked for that exact destructive action.
- Do not push directly to the default / protected branch, and rewrite published history only with the leased force push described in [Delivery](references/delivery.md). Ordinary implementation and PR-creation requests do not authorize merging; merge only when explicitly requested and permitted by repository and runtime rules.
- Commit, push, and create pull requests only within the user's request or an explicit standing authorization. Permission to execute a command is not authorization to perform that action for the task. Do not repeat confirmation for steps already covered by the authorized workflow; runtime approval requirements still apply.
- When commits are authorized, group them by reviewable intent. Multiple TSDD cycles may belong to one commit; do not force a commit for every cycle.
- Keep branch names and commit subjects aligned with the primary intent of the change, not with filenames.

Review-only requests authorize inspection and findings, not edits or delivery. A request to fix a bug
covers implementation and verification, not commits or publication. A request to fix and commit
adds local recording; a request to fix and open a PR also covers necessary commits and pushes, but
not merging.

Read only the reference needed for the current Git operation. Continue to use the selected
checkout and branch while they remain suitable for the task.
